## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Important
1. **Never commit API keys** to Git
2. Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `.gitignore`
3. Use environment variables in production
4. Enable Firestore security rules (see SETUP.md)
5. Implement rate limiting for API calls

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] Remove admin bypass in AuthView
- [ ] Add API key validation
- [ ] Implement request throttling
- [ ] Enable Firestore security rules
- [ ] Use HTTPS only
- [ ] Add certificate pinning
- [ ] Obfuscate API calls

---

## 🎯 Production Considerations

### Backend Scheduler (Critical!)
The current implementation triggers Twilio reminders immediately. For production, you **must** implement a backend scheduler:

**Options:**
1. **Firebase Cloud Functions** (Recommended)
   ```javascript
   exports.sendScheduledReminders = functions.pubsub
     .schedule('every 1 minutes')
     .onRun(async (context) => {
       // Query Firestore for tasks with reminders due now
       // Call Twilio API
     });
   ```

2. **AWS Lambda** with CloudWatch Events
3. **Heroku Scheduler**
4. **Google Cloud Scheduler**

### Cost Management
- Monitor OpenAI token usage
- Set Twilio spending limits
- Cache GPT responses where possible
- Implement API call quotas per user

### Performance
- Add loading states everywhere
- Implement pagination for task lists
- Use Firebase query limits
- Add offline mode support
- Cache user data locally

---
